# Project Description 
The project aims at predicting Covid-19 mortality in patients with pre-existing health conditions

## Reason for topic/dataset selection
The Coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is an infectious disease caused by a novel virus that has posed varying health risks and caused significant mortality acorss the world. The initial days of the pandemic had many unknowns and it was observed by medical professionals that the covid-19 symptoms were more severe and mortality was high in patients having certain pre-existing health conditions. This understanding was initially based on the general trend of the deaths happening at that point in time but now with significant data available for many covid-19 patients, machine learning models could be applied to scientifically find a correlation between the mortality due to covid-19 and pre-existing health conditions. Hence, the mexican covid-19 patient dataset was selected to study this correlation and to also use machine learning to determine if having any underlying health condition enhances the symptoms associated with covid-19.

	-	DATE_SYMPTOMS	Identifies the date on which the patient's symptoms began.
	-	DATE_DIED	Identifies the date the patient died.
	-	INTUBED	Identifies if the patient required intubation.
	-	PNEUMONIA	Identifies if the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia.
	-	AGE	Identifies the age of the patient.
	-	PREGNANCY	Identifies if the patient is pregnant.
	-	DIABETES	Identifies if the patient has a diagnosis of diabetes.

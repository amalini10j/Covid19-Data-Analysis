# PREDICTING COVID-19 MORBIDITY IN PATIENTS WITH PRE-EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS 

----------


## Introduction


## Machine Learning Model


## Database
Our provisional database is a csv file of patient-related information released daily by the Mexican government of patients infected with COVID-19. For Machine Learning exploration, we will be using a subset of the data (1/1/2020-5/31/2020) and once a final model has been decided upon and tested, we will implement the full-scale dataset.

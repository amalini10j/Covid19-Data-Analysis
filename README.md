# Project Description 
The project aims at predicting Covid-19 mortality in patients with pre-existing health conditions.
Additional details are mentioned below:
- This dataset provides information on underlying conditions of patients who tested covid positive.
- We plan on using this dataset to predict if the patient died or not considering their demographics and underlying health conditions and if they were intubed or not.
- Our target variable which gives the date when the patient died, else a 9999-99-99 if patient did not die, could be changed to a binary value of 1 and 0 to use for our classification model.

## Reason for topic/dataset selection
The Coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is an infectious disease caused by a novel virus that has posed varying health risks and caused significant mortality acorss the world. The initial days of the pandemic had many unknowns and it was observed by medical professionals that the covid-19 symptoms were more severe and mortality was high in patients having certain pre-existing health conditions. This understanding was initially based on the general trend of the deaths happening at that point in time but now with significant data available for many covid-19 patients, machine learning models could be applied to scientifically find a correlation between the mortality due to covid-19 and pre-existing health conditions. Hence, the mexican covid-19 patient dataset was selected to study this correlation and to also use machine learning to determine if having any underlying health condition aggravates the symptoms associated with covid-19.

# Covid19-Data-Analysis
Repository to build a machine learning model on Covid19 dataset for insights and prediction
Reason for selecting this dataset:
- This dataset provides information on underlying conditions of patients who tested covid positive.
- We plan on using this dataset to predict if the patient died or not died considering their demographics and underlying health conditions and if they were intubed or not.
- SVM machine learning is best used when the output data needs to be classifed two categories. For this dataset, did the covid patient die or not die.
